# mpdtouch

It's another mpd client for touchscreens. Written in python with Kivy and Twisted.
You can navigate your mpd music collection by genre , artist, album.

I do not know if the touchscreen would really work with it, i  don't have one.

Mostly, it's a proof-of-concept. **DO NOT USE IT** for production or as your regular playback software.
Many improvements could be done, but I think that I will not pursue this task : it works well enough for my use.

There can be various issues, I only spent 5 days to write it, and I'm satisfied for the result given the work.
I had in mind to build a headless music player with a touchscreen, so I tried to make a GUI for mpd : here it is.

To run tha app, launch main.py with python (2.7).
Maybe will there be someone who will get inspired ... (?)
