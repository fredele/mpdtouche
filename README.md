# mpdtouch

It's another mpd client for touchscreens. Written in python with Kivy and Twisted.
You can navigate your mpd music collection by genre , artist, album.

I do not know if the touchscreen would really work with it, i  don't have one.

Mostly, it's a proof-of-concept. **DO NOT USE IT** for production or as your regular playback software.
Many improvements could be done, but I think that I will not pursue this task : it works well enough for my use.

There can be various issues, I only spent 5 days to write it.
